## Project Description

This repository contains Python code that uses **MapReduce** to analyze text data extracted from the Harry Potter books. The project includes two main tasks:

1. **Word Count in `file1.txt`**: Counts the number of occurrences of each word in a section of the Harry Potter book.
2. **Non-English Word Count in `file2.txt`**: Identifies and counts non-English words (e.g., names, places, spells) in another section of the book.

## Files in the Repository

- **`word_count.py`**: A Python script that uses MapReduce to count occurrences of each word in `file1.txt`.
- **`non_english_word_count.py`**: A Python script that uses MapReduce to count occurrences of non-English words in `file2.txt`.
- **`file1.txt`**: A text file containing an excerpt from the Harry Potter book based on the instructions (birth month).
- **`file2.txt`**: A text file containing another excerpt from the Harry Potter book based on the instructions (birth year).

## Task 1: Word Count (`word_count.py`)

This script processes `file1.txt` and counts the occurrences of each word using MapReduce. The output will show how many times each word is repeated in the text.

## Task 2: Non Word Count (`non_word_count.py`)

This script processes `file2.txt` and counts the occurrences of each word using MapReduce. The output will show how many times each non word is repeated in the text.
